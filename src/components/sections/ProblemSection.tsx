                Teachers of neurodivergent students face a critical visibility gap. Traditional classroom feedback mechanisms—raised hands, facial expressions, even test scores—often fail to reveal the true cognitive experience of students with ADHD, autism, or learning differences. Without real-time insights into moments of confusion, engagement, or understanding, educators are forced to teach in the dark, only discovering learning gaps when it's too late to address them effectively.
